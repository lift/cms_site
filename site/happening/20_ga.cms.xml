	    <h1>Announcing Lift 2.0</h1>
	    <p>June 30th, 2010<br />
	    </p>
	    <p>The <a href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a> team and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb">Lift community</a> are proud to announce the availability of <a href="http://liftweb.net/download.html">Lift 2.0</a><br />

	      <blockquote>"Lift is the kind of web framework that enables you as a developer to
		concentrate on the big picture. Strong, expressive typing and
		higher-level features like the built-in Comet support allow you to
		focus on innovating instead of the plumbing. Building a rich, real-time
		web application like Novell Pulse requires a framework with the power
		of Lift under the covers."

	      <blockquote>
		"Foursquare switched over to Scala &amp; Lift last September and
		we've been thrilled with the results.  The ease of developing complex
		interactive ajax web pages enabled a very rapid port from our previous
		platform.  In addition, the support we've gotten from David Pollak and
		the rest of the Lift team has been invaluable. It's clear they are
		very committed to making sure that production Lift deployments get all
		the attention they need to succeed."

	    <p>Lift is an elegant, expressive web framework that allows any size
	      team build and maintain secure, highly interactive, scalable web
	      applicationsquickly and efficiently.&nbsp; Lift is built on the  <a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> and compiles
	      to JVM byte-code.&nbsp; Lift applications deploy as WAR files on
	      popular application servers and web cotainers including Jetty,
	      Glassfish and Tomcat.&nbsp; Lift applications can be monitored and
	      managed with the same proven infrastructure used to manage and monitor
	      any Java web application.&nbsp; Lift is open source licensed under an Apache 2.0 license.<br />
