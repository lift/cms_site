          <p>The Lift team proudly announces the <a href="/download">availability</a>
            of the Milestone 4 release of Lift version 2.5.
          </p>
          <p>Lift is the most powerful, secure and mature web framework available today. There are
            <a href="http://seventhings.liftweb.net/" target="_blank">Seven Things</a>
            that distinguish Lift from other web frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>Lift applications are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Secure -- Lift apps are resistant to common vulnerabilities including many of the OWASP Top 10</li>
            <li>Developer centric -- Lift apps are fast to build, concise and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>Scalable -- Lift apps are high performance and scale in the real world to handle insane traffic levels</li>
            <li>Interactive like a desktop app -- Lift's Comet support is unparalleled and Lift's ajax support is super-easy and very secure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Read an <a href="/lift_overview">overview</a> of how Lift achieves these important goals.</p>
          <p>Lift open source software licensed under an Apache 2.0 license.</p>

          <h3>Breaking changes</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/lift/framework/issues/1383">Couchdb-record was moved to an external module</a>
          <span>This means that you will have to modify your dependencies to:</span>
          <pre><code>
               GroupId: net.liftmodules
            ArtifactId: lift-couchdb
               version: 2.5-M4-1.1 //Note that the 2.5-M4 means the version of Lift that the module was built for.
          </code></pre>
          <span>You will also have to rename your imports. Replace <pre><code>import net.liftweb.couchdb</code></pre> for
            <pre><code>import net.liftmodules.couchdb</code></pre>
          </span>
          <a href="https://github.com/lift/framework/issues/1343">Ensure equals method works properly with all Fields</a>
          <span>This was in 2.5-M3, but was not included in the braking changes.</span>
          <span>The problem is that before when there was no value set, Mongodb received defaultValue.
            Now problem is that it gets JNull if no value is set.
            Loading next time you get exception because Lift tries to parse JNull into something meaningfull</span>
          <span>If you application broke after this change, one solution is to use <pre><code>override def optional_? = true</code></pre></span>
