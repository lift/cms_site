	<h1>Announcing Lift 2.4-M3</h1>
	<p>July 21, 2011<br />
	</p>
<p>Lift is the most powerful, most secure web framework available
today. There are
Seven Things that distinguish Lift from other web
frameworks. Lift applications are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Secure -- Lift apps are resistant to common vulnerabilities
including many of the OWASP Top 10</li>
<li>Developer centeric -- Lift apps are fast to build, concise and
easy to maintain</li>
<li>Scalable -- Lift apps are high performance and scale in the real
world to handle insane traffic levels</li>
<li>Interactive like a desktop app -- Lift's Comet support is
unparalleled and Lift's ajax support is super-easy and very secure</li>
</ul>
Sites powered by Lift include <a href="http://foursquare.com/"

href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/" target="_blank">UK Guardian</a>, and

<br />
The Lift team is excited to announce the <a
href="http://liftweb.net/download" target="_blank">availability</a> of
Lift 2.4-M3 (Milestone 3).<br />
<br />
Lift 2.4-M3 supports Scala 2.8.x as well as 2.9.x.<br />
<br />
The Lift team added over <a
href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/milestones/387120"
target="_blank">20 enhancements</a> or bug fixes since Lift 2.4-M2.
<br />
<em>Noteworthy breaking change:</em><br />
As announced earlier, JavaMail dependency has been upgraded to 1.4.4 which is formally available from Java.net Maven 2 repository (and not from Maven central). As a result, existing applications would need to add the repository in the SBT project file as so:<br />
<blockquote>
<code>lazy val JavaNet = "Java.net Maven2 Repository" at "http://download.java.net/maven/2/"</code>
</blockquote>
