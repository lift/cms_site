	<h1>Announcing Lift 2.2-M1</h1>
	<p>November 3rd, 2010<br />

						   href="http://liftweb.net/download.html">Lift 2.2-M1</a><br />
	</p>
	<p>Lift is an elegant, expressive framework that allows any size
	  team build and maintain secure, highly interactive, scalable web
	  applications quickly and efficiently.&nbsp; Lift is built on the <a
									     href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> and compiles to JVM
	  byte-code.&nbsp; Lift applications deploy as WAR files on popular
	  application servers and web cotainers including Jetty, Glassfish and
	  Tomcat.&nbsp; Lift applications can be monitored and managed with the
	  same proven infrastructure used to manage and monitor any Java web
	  application.&nbsp; Lift is open source licensed under an Apache 2.0
	  license.<br />
