					Lift is the kind of web framework that enables you as a developer to
					concentrate on the big picture. Strong, expressive typing and
					higher-level features like the built-in Comet support <strong>allow you to
					focus on innovating</strong> instead of the
					plumbing. Building a rich, real-time web application like Novell Pulse
					requires a framework with the power of Lift
					under the covers.
