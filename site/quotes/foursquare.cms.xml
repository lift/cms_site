				<h2>The ease of developing!</h2>
				<p class="lead">
					Foursquare switched over to Scala &amp; Lift last September and we've been
					thrilled with the results. The ease of developing complex
					interactive ajax web pages enabled a very rapid port from our
					previous platform. In addition, the support we've gotten from David
					Pollak and the rest of the Lift team has been invaluable. It's
					clear they are very committed to making sure that production Lift
					deployments get all the attention they need to succeed.
