<!-- 				<h2>Realize the developer efficiency!</h2> -->
				<p class="lead">
					When I decided to put Innovation GamesÂ® online, I knew that I couldn't
					afford a massive development effort. I needed a small, sharp team
					who could leverage best-in-class tools to help us solve the
					problems we knew that we'd have to solve in creating a new kind of
					collaborative gaming experience on the web. David suggested Lift
					and Scala and initial testing proved that we could <strong>realize the
					developer efficiency</strong> and backend scalability that we felt was
					required to efficiently support thousands of simultaneous games.
