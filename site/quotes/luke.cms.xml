				<h2>Realize the developer efficiency!</h2>
				<p class="lead">
					When I decided to put Innovation Games® online, I knew that I couldn't
					afford a massive development effort. I needed a small, sharp team
					who could leverage best-in-class tools to help us solve the
					problems we knew that we'd have to solve in creating a new kind of
					collaborative gaming experience on the web. David suggested Lift
					and Scala and initial testing proved that we could realize the
					developer efficiency and backend scalability that we felt was
					required to efficiently support thousands of simultaneous games.
