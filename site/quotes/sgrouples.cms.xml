					Sgrouples is a social platform with a new approach to privacy and security
					on the web. Our team pushed Sgrouples from conceptual ideas to a
					publicly available release in just nine months. Some reasons we
					chose the Lift framework are its <strong>security-driven design</strong> and its
					<strong>stellar Ajax and Comet support</strong>. Lift paves the way for a secure,
					responsive real time application that is fun to use and even
					greater fun to develop.
