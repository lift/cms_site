				<h2>Comet made easy!</h2>
				<p class="lead">
					Lift's excellent 'Comet made easy' philosophy 
					made it an absoluteno-brainer as the choice of framework for the 
					Apache ESME project. Additionally, the fact that Lift-based 
					applications run unchangedon the SAP's NetWeaver CE Java 
					application server makes this an intriguing approach for enterprise 
					applications in the SAP world.
