					Lift's excellent <strong>'Comet made easy'</strong> philosophy 
					made it an absolute no-brainer as the choice of framework for the 
					Apache ESME project. Additionally, the fact that Lift-based 
					applications run unchanged on the SAP's NetWeaver CE Java 
					application server makes this an intriguing approach for enterprise 
					applications in the SAP world.
