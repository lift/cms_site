					Lift is the only new framework in the last four
					years to offer fresh and innovative approaches to web development.
					It's not just some incremental improvements over the status quo,
					it redefines the <strong>state of the art</strong>. If you are a web developer,
					you should learn Lift. Even if you don't wind up using it everyday,
					it will change the way you approach web applications.
