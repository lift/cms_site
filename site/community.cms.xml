							<h1>The Lift Community <small>and Expected Behavior</small></h1>
							</div>
							<p>
								The Lift community strives to be a warm and welcoming place to
								newbies and seasoned users alike.
								If you've got a question, the community will try to provide a
								substantive answer (not RTFM.)
							</p>

							<p>
								The
								<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb">Lift mailing list</a>
								is the official support channel for Lift.
								The IRC channel is a popular, but unofficial, support channel for
								Lift.
							</p>

							
							<div class="well">
								<dl>
								    <dt>The following are not ways to get support for Lift:</dt>
									<dd><i class="icon-hand-right" style="vertical-align: midle;"></i> Personal email to one of the committers (unless you have a
										relationship with that committer)</dd>
									<dd><i class="icon-hand-right" style="vertical-align: midle;"></i> Personal IM with the committers (unless you know them very
										well)</dd>
									<dd><i class="icon-hand-right" style="vertical-align: midle;"></i> Twitter... the Lift committers don't monitor Twitter for
										Lift support requests</dd>
									<dd><i class="icon-hand-right" style="vertical-align: midle;"></i> GitHub... don't use GitHub messages.
										None of the Lift committer will pull from your repository.
										The Lift IP is clean which means that unless you are a committer
										and you have written the code yourself,
										it doesn't get into Lift. This allows businesses to use Lift
										knowing what the provenance of the code is.
									</dd>
								</dl>
							</div>
							

							<p>
								Please be polite on the Lift mailing list. Please say "please" and
								"thank you."
								The community tries to be timely with answers, but very often a
								question may not get an
								answer for a few days. Being a squeaky wheel about getting an answer
								will not make it
								happen any faster. There are people on the Lift list who are
								consultants. If you need
								support in a timely manner and are willing to pay, please make that
								offer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Disagreements... there are plenty of ways to approach technical
								issues. Lift was built from user
								feedback and we try to foster a community in which feedback is
								encouraged. But this
								implies certain ground rules:
							  <div class="well">
								<dl>
								    <dt>Ground rules:</dt>
									<dd><i class="icon-thumbs-up" style="vertical-align: midle;"></i> You can disagree with a person's opinion, but please
										continue to respect the person</dd>
									<dd><i class="icon-thumbs-up" style="vertical-align: midle;"></i> Using words like "nightmare", "sucks", and other similar
										words will not help your cause.
										Please spend time working on the positives of your position rather
										than focusing on the
										negatives of other peoples' positions.
									</dd>
									<dd><i class="icon-thumbs-up" style="vertical-align: midle;"></i> You may have to agree to disagree</dd>
								</dl>
							  </div>
							</p>

							<p>
								New member of the group are moderated (this radically reduces
								spam). You may have to wait
								2 to 24 hours for a post to be moderated. Please do not repost
								the same question if you don't
								see it show up immediately.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lift is an open source project done entirely by volunteers. The Lift
								documentation is not professional.
								If you would like improvements to the documentation, please write
								wiki articles or add a <a href="http://cookbook.liftweb.net/How+to+add+a+new+recipe+to+this+Cookbook.html">recipe</a> to <a href="http://cookbook.liftweb.net/">Lift Cookbook</a>. Posting complaints
								about the documentation on the mailing list does not help it appear
								faster. Posting questions
								and summarizing the answer into a cookbok recipe or a wiki post on the other hand will
								earn you faster and more detailed
								answers in the future.
							</p>

								Before opening a ticket, please discuss it on the Lift Google Group.
								For more information,
								<a href="https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Creating_tickets">Creating Tickets</a>
								outlines the rules for opening tickets. We have this policy to
								keep Lift-related discussions
								in the open and available to every community member.
